- 👋 Hi, I’m @mwurie20
- 👀 I’m interested in using data to solve problems you didn't really expect could be solved with data ❤️
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tensorflow & linear algebra. Very much a newb, but we got this :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with a fun spin (music, pop culture, nights out) and equity projects (BLM, anti-racism, intersectionality).
- 📫 How to reach me: via my Medium :) mwurie20.medium.com/
